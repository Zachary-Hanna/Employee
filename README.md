# Employee
Description:
In this program, a class named 'Employee' is created. The class contains 3 instance private variables that store 
the employee's name, ID number, and hire date. A Java constructor is activated when an object is 
created; the constructor creates the values for the object. The constructor will initialize the name, ID number, 
and hire date of the employee. Everything that is initialized has its own setter and getter.
